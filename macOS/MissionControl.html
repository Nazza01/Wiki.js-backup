<p>When Mission Control just doesn't want to work with the Logitech Mouse (Might also apply to different types of mice too!)</p>
<p>Go to Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts Tab &gt; Click on Mission Control on the left hand side</p>
<p>Enable both (Make sure shortcuts are set as well (ctl left for left and ctl right for right)</p>
<p>Move left a space<br>Move right a space</p>
