<p>Could not find any man pages in the code-server container while in the terminal and had to re-download the man pages. Turned out the dpkg.cfg.d/excludes was blocking man pages as below.<br>From: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/484705/see-man-7-undocumented-for-help-when-manual-pages-are-not-available-wsl-core</p>
<p>The first two lines of <code>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># Drop all man pages
path-exclude=/usr/share/man/*</code></pre>
<p>This causes all man pages to be dropped when packages are installed.</p>
<p>To make man pages available, youâ€™ll have to comment the second line out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># Drop all man pages
# path-exclude=/usr/share/man/*</code></pre>
<p>then re-install any package for which you want the man pages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">apt --reinstall install man-db coreutils</code></pre>
<p>to restore the <code>man</code> and <code>ls</code> man pages (among others).<br><br>Had to reinstall the development and POSIX man pages as they were not found after doing all of the above</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo apt --reinstall install manpages-posix man-pages-dev man-db</code></pre>
<p>I can finally do</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">man atoi
man malloc
man strlen</code></pre>
