<p>Had an issue where after updating code-server, I didn't have gcc, make or man pages anymore<br>Edit (or remove) the following file <code>/etc/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes</code><br>And once you've done that come back here and enter the below command (installs gcc, man pages, make and other various needed things)</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo apt --reinstall install coreutils man-db manpages-posix manpages-dev</code></pre>
<p>Once all that is done, you will need to reinstall norminette as it errors out when updating the code-server</p>
<p>install pip</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo apt-get install python3-pip</code></pre>
<p>Once that has installed we want to install pip's setuptools and install norminette</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
python3 -m pip install norminette</code></pre>
