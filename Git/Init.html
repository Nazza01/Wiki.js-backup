<p>For an existing code repo that you want to resubmit (42 School)<br>You may want to re-submit the code and make a few changes.</p>
<p>In my case I have libft to still get marked and as such, need to make changes to my code then re-submit again.</p>
<p>I have my existing folder setup as so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">$ ls ~/42Git/libft
		.git		Old Git repo folder
		.gitignore	Git ignore file
		*.c			Source files
		*.h			Header files
		Makefile	Source Makefile
		........	Other files</code></pre>
<p>If I make any changes to my code and the repo is no longer able to be committed to (after submitting subscribe to a defence)<br>Rather than copy all the old files over. We can re-use the existing code and re-commit it using the below commands.</p>
<p>This all assumes that you have the git repository link after clicking re-try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Remove the hidden old .git repository folder</p>
<p>I need to remove the old .git folder like so</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">$ rm -rf .git</code></pre>
<p>Step 2: Intialise the current directory (e.g. libft) as a local git repository.<br>Make sure you are in the correct directory, creates the local .git folder, link the local git repo to the remote url and add the local files to be committed to the git repo.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">pwd: ~/42Git/libft
git&nbsp;init
git remote add origin &lt;url&gt;
git&nbsp;add&nbsp;.</code></pre>
<p>Before you submit a commit message before pushing your code up you need to set up your git configuration with your email and name used for the git commit logs/details:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">git config user.email "you@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"
git&nbsp;commit -m "message"</code></pre>
<p>You will need to push the intial commit to the origin main branch so the future commits will know where to go</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">git push --set-upstream origin main</code></pre>
