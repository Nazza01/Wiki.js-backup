<p>For an existing code repo that you want to resubmit (42 School)<br>You may want to re-submit the code and make a few changes.</p>
<p>In my case I have libft to still get marked and as such, need to make changes to my code then re-submit again.</p>
<p>I have my existing folder setup as so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">$ ls ~/42Git/libft
		.git		Old Git repo folder
		.gitignore	Git ignore file
		*.c			Source files
		*.h			Header files
		Makefile	Source Makefile
		........	Other files</code></pre>
<p>If I make any changes to my code and the repo is no longer able to be committed to (after submitting subscribe to a defence)<br>Rather than copy all the old files over. We can re-use the existing code and re-commit it using the below commands.</p>
<p>This all assumes that you have the git repository link after clicking re-try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Remove the hidden old .git repository folder</p>
<p>I need to remove the old .git folder like so</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">$ rm -rf .git					-Remove the .git folder recursively and forcefully</code></pre>
<p>Step 2: Intialise the current directory (e.g. libft) as a local git repository.<br>Make sure you are in the correct directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">pwd: ~/42Git/libft				-Check the current directory
git&nbsp;init						-Create the .git folder to start the git repo
git remote add origin &lt;url&gt;		-Link the local .git folder to the remote location
git&nbsp;add&nbsp;.&nbsp;						-Add the local files in the current directory to the files to be commited</code></pre>
<p>Before you submit a commit message before pushing your code up you need to set up your git configuration with your email and name used for the git commit logs/details:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">git config user.email "you@example.com		-Add your details in here so logs can be easily traceable
git config user.name "Your Name"			-Add your name for logs' sake
git&nbsp;commit -m "message"						-Add a message to your logs for reference</code></pre>
<p>You will need to push the intial commit to the origin master branch so the future commits will know where to go</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">git push --set-upstream origin master		-Make the current commit branch a link to the origin master on the server</code></pre>
