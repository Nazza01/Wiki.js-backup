<p>This is for vaultwarden - a selfhosted lightweight bitwarden instance.</p>
<p>The services we want for this stack is vaultwarden.&nbsp;<br>We then define the image to pull (the latest image)<br>We define the container should only stop when we press the stop button.<br>Open port 8800 (host) and map them to port 80 (container)<br>- This is especially useful for when you have a few services set up on existing ports on the host and want to remap another service to a different port<br>Open port 3012 (host) and map them to port 3012 (container)<br>Define the WEBSOCKET_ENABLED environment variable to be true<br>Map a bind mount (host folder) to the /data folder located in the container - this folder must already be created on the host server as there will be errors if it is not already there.<br>&nbsp;</p>
