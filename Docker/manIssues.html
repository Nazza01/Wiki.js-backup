<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Issues arose with trying to use the following docker container for coding and looking for man-pages. Initially I thought what was the problem related to not having them installed.</p>
<p>I could not find any man pages in the code-server container while in the terminal and had to re-download the man pages. Turned out the dpkg.cfg.d/excludes was blocking man pages as below.<br>From: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/484705/see-man-7-undocumented-for-help-when-manual-pages-are-not-available-wsl-core</p>
<p>The first two lines of <code>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># Drop all man pages
path-exclude=/usr/share/man/*</code></pre>
<p>This causes all man pages to be dropped when packages are installed.</p>
<p>To make man pages available, you’ll have to comment the second line out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># Drop all man pages
# path-exclude=/usr/share/man/*</code></pre>
<p>then re-install any package for which you want the man pages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">apt --reinstall install coreutils man-db manpages-posix manpages-dev</code></pre>
<p>to restore the <code>man</code> and <code>ls</code> man pages (among others).</p>
<p>I can finally do</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">man atoi
man malloc
man strlen</code></pre>
<p>But! <code>man ascii</code> did not work - Hence the solution to the problem is below!</p>
<h1>The Solution™</h1>
<p>Docker Container: https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/code-server<br>General idea for the fix: https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core/issues/122#issuecomment-380529430<br><br>For my specific case I had to do the following while inside the code-server's terminal</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">#Execute while in root access
sudo -i
# Do not exclude man pages &amp; other documentation
rm /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes
# Reinstall all currently installed packages in order to get the man pages back
apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
	dpkg -l | grep ^ii | cut -d' ' -f3 | xargs apt-get install -y --reinstall &amp;&amp; \
    rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*</code></pre>
