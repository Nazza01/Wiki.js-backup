<p>portainer how-to (Get Docker agent with host management to work)</p>
<p>make a section for each of my services</p>
<p>nextcloud instance to not have errors (found this to help me - https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/issues/399)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>norminette working on code-server - Had to install python3.9, pip and norminette then use PATH to export where the code-server stores scripts (nano .bashrc)</p>
